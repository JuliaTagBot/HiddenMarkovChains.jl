# HiddenMarkovChains â€” a Julia library

This is a preliminary collection of functions I use for calculations that involve Hidden Markov Chains (HMC).

Recommended usage:
```julia
import HiddenMarkovChains            # import instead of using
const HMC = HiddenMarkovChains       # use a shorter alias

# given transition matrix P and observation probabilities Q ...
p = HMC.steadystate(P)
path_probs = HMC.path_probabilities(P, Q, p, 4)
```
where the last line will return the probability of each *observed* path of length 4, as a `Dict`.
